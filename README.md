# Introduction
Welcome to the **LiveBoost** repository of datasets and code sharing.
The goal of this repository is to make our method more transparent and reproducible.

# Webtool

# Datasets
**Discovery_set.csv** is the discovery dataset contains 490 HBV infected subjects with their histopathologic staging of hepatic fibrosis, Age, AST, ALT, PLT, and FIB4.

**Validation_set1.csv** is the validation dataset-1 contains 86 HBV infected subjects with their histopathologic staging of hepatic fibrosis, Age, AST, ALT, PLT, and FIB4.
